Deprecate all the things

> With great modules comes great responsibility; mark things deprecated!

## Install

This module is installed directly using `npm`:

```sh
$ npm install depd
```

This module can also be bundled with systems like
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/),
though by default this module will alter it's API to no longer display or
track deprecations.

## API

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->

```js
var deprecate = require('depd')('my-module')
```

This library allows you to display deprecation messages to your users.
This library goes above and beyond with deprecation warnings by
introspection of the call stack (but only the bits that it is interested
in).

Instead of just warning on the first invocation of a deprecated
function and never again, this module will warn on the first invocation
of a deprecated function per unique call site, making it ideal to alert
users of all deprecated uses across the code base, rather than just
whatever happens to execute first.

The deprecation warnings from this module also include the file and line
information for the call into the module that the deprecated function was
in.

**NOTE** this library has a similar interface to the `debug` module, and
this module uses the calling file to get the boundary for the call stacks,
so you should always create a new `deprecate` object in each file and not
within some central file.

### depd(namespace)

Create a new deprecate function that uses the given namespace name in the
messages and will display the call site prior to the stack entering the
file this function was called from. It is highly suggested you use the
name of your module as the namespace.

### deprecate(message)

Call this function from deprecated code to display a deprecation message.
This message will appear once per unique caller site. Caller site is the
first call site in the stack in a different file from the caller of this
function.

If the message is omitted, a message is generated for you based on the site
of the `deprecate()` call and will display the name of the function called,
similar to the name displayed in a stack trace.

### deprecate.function(fn, message)

Call this function to wrap a given function in a deprecation message on any
call to the function. An optional message can be supplied to provide a custom
message.

### deprecate.property(obj, prop, message)

Call this function to wrap a given property on object in a deprecation message
on any accessing or setting of the property. An optional message can be supplied
to provide a custom message.

The method must be called on the object where the property belongs (not
inherited from the prototype).

If the property is
