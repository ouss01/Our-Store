/**
 * A histogram log reader.
 * <p>
 * Histogram logs are used to capture full fidelity, per-time-interval
 * histograms of a recorded value.
 * <p>
 * For example, a histogram log can be used to capture high fidelity
 * reaction-time logs for some measured system or subsystem component.
 * Such a log would capture a full reaction time histogram for each
 * logged interval, and could be used to later reconstruct a full
 * HdrHistogram of the measured reaction time behavior for any arbitrary
 * time range within the log, by adding [only] the relevant interval
 * histograms.
 * <h3>Histogram log format:</h3>
 * A histogram log file consists of text lines. Lines beginning with
 * the "#" character are optional and treated as comments. Lines
 * containing the legend (starting with "Timestamp") are also optional
 * and ignored in parsing the histogram log
