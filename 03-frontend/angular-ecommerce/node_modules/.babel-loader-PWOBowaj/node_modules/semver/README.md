semver(1) -- The semantic versioner for npm
===========================================

## Install

```bash
npm install --save semver
````

## Usage

As a node module:

```js
const semver = require('semver')

semver.valid('1.2.3') // '1.2.3'
semver.valid('a.b.c') // null
semver.clean('  =v1.2.3   ') // '1.2.3'
semver.satisfies('1.2.3', '1.x || >=2.5.0 || 5.0.0 - 7.2.3') // true
semver.gt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // false
semver.lt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // true
semver.minVersion('>=1.0.0') // '1.0.0'
semver.valid(semver.coerce('v2')) // '2.0.0'
semver.valid(semver.coerce('42.6.7.9.3-alpha')) // '42.6.7'
```

As a command-line utility:

```
$ semver -h

A JavaScript implementation of the https://semver.org/ specification

Usage: semver [options] <version> [<version> [...]]
Prints valid versions sorted by SemVer precedence

Options:
-r --range <range>
        Print versions that match the specified range.

-i --increment [<level>]
        Increment a version by the specified level.  Level can
        be one of: major, minor, patch, premajor, preminor,
        prepatch, or prerelease.  Default level is 'patch'.
        Only one version may be specified.

--preid <identifier>
        Identifier to be used to prefix premajor, preminor,
        prepatch or prerelease version increments.

-l --loose
        Interpret versions and ranges loosely

-p --include-prerelease
        Always include prerelease versions in range matching

-c --coerce
        Coerce a string into SemVer if possible
        (does not imply --loose)

Program exits successfully if any valid version satisfies
all supplied ranges, and prints all satisfying versions.

If no satisfying versions are found, then exits failure.

Versions are printed in ascending order, so supplying
multiple versions to the utility will just sort them.

## Versions

A "version" is described by the `v2.0.0` specification found at
<https://semver.org/>.

A leading `"="` or `"v"` character is stripped off and ignored.

## Ranges

A `version range` is a set of `comparators` which specify versions
that satisfy the range.

A `comparator` is composed of an `operator` and a `version`.  The set
of primitive `operators` is:

* `<` Less than
* `<=` Less than or equal to
* `>` Greater than
* `>=` Greater than or equal to
* `=` Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,
  so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.

For example, the comparator `>=1.2.7` would match the versions
`1.2.7`, `1.2.8`, `2.5.3`, and `1.3.9`, but not the versions `1.2.6`
or `1.1.0`.

Comparators can be joined by whitespace to form a `comparator set`,
which is satisfied by the **intersection** of all of the comparators
it includes.

A range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by `||`.  A
version matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least
one of the `||`-separate
